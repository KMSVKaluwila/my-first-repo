# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sachin Kaluwila!

I'm an **Undergraduate IT Student** at **Gampaha Wickramarachchi University of Indigenous Medicine**. My academic work is strongly focused on the intersection of technology and healthcareâ€”**Health Informatics**.

I build and break things using a modern stack:
* **Backend/Data:** **Python**, **SQL**, **Java**
* **Frontend:** **JavaScript**, **React JS**

I'm always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to meaningful problems in the health tech space. Check out my pinned projects below!
